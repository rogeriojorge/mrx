"""Tutorial 5: drive field with an external current

Tutorials 3 and 4 stayed ideal (eta = 0). The flow is frozen into the field and lowers the
energy without ever changing the topology of the field, so the islands that Tutorial 4
opened survive the relaxation. 

A drive breaks that constraint. After every ideal step, a backward-Euler resistive step 
``dB/dt = -eta curl (J - J*)`` of size ``eps = C h_r^2`` (``h_r`` the radial cell size)
pulls the current towards ``J*``, the current of a reference field ``B*``.

Here the reference is the unseeded nested state of Tutorial 3. Field lines can now reconnect and the
helicity is no longer conserved. A field with the current ``J*`` differs from ``B*`` by a harmonic field
of zero flux, which is zero, so the drive pulls the seeded field towards the reference. On this coarse
mesh the reference has chains of its own (a wide one at iota = 1/2), and the driven field takes on the
reference's chains instead of the seeded ones. This is
``scripts/relax.py --drive.resistivity C --drive.reference REF --drive.reference-smoothing 0``.

The run starts from the seeded, relaxed state of Tutorial 4 (``outputs/tutorials/4_li383_island_seed``,
whose ``reference.h5`` is the unseeded floor), or builds the same here when that run is absent. 
It then takes ``--budget.steps`` Newton steps with the drive on. The script
prints the step size, and after every chunk the force residual, the helicity and the distance to the 
reference. Before and after the drive it prints the island width of every seeded chain from the sections (the
radial extent of the lines locked to its rotational transform). The sections trace ``--lines`` field lines
(160 by default, the paper's li383 figures trace 320 for 600 periods) for ``--periods`` field periods (400 by default).
