# Relaxation

`mrx/relaxation/` (`loop.py`, `physics.py`) descends the magnetic energy `E = ||B||^2_{M_2} / 2` of a
divergence-free Dirichlet 2-form `B` (`B . n = 0`) along an incompressible,
wall-tangent flow, which conserves the helicity up to grid-scale effects. The fixed point is
`J x B = grad p` with `p` the Lagrange multiplier: a finite-beta equilibrium.
`scripts/relax.py` is the driver ([Solve a relaxation problem](../relaxation.md)).
On a half-period sequence `B`, `J` and `E` live on `seq.odd`, the velocity,
the force and the pressures on `seq.even` ([Architecture](architecture.md)).

## 1. The force

The relaxation forms the force by the potential route:

1. `J = seq.M[1].solve(seq.D[1].T @ B)`, the weak curl (`seq.weak_curl(B)`): one k = 1 mass solve.
2. `load(J x B)`, the Lorentz force tested against the 2-form basis, not projected.
3. `L_1 a = curl^T load(J x B)`: one k = 1 Hodge solve for the force potential `a`. The force is
   `F = curl a + c h`, with `c h` its harmonic part (zero for the even force of a half-period sequence).

`F` is the divergence-free projection of `J x B`, the Riesz representative of `-grad E` among
divergence-free fields, with no pressure solve. Every solve is warm-started from the previous step's value.
`compute_force(B, seq, p_guess, JxB_guess, J_guess, F_guess)` returns the same projection by the Leray
route, a k = 3 saddle solve that also gives the strong pressure `p`. The sampler calls it once per chunk
for that pressure.

## 2. The step

`TimeStepper(seq, newton, newton_penalty, newton_tol, newton_maxiter, resistivity, resistive_current, current_profile)`
is an `eqx.Module`. `relaxation_step(state)` does one forward-Euler step
`B_{n+1} = B_n + dt curl(u x B)`:

1. **Direction** `u`. With `newton`, the Newton direction (below). Without,
   the smoothed force,
   `u = curl (M_1 + mu L_1)^{-1} M_1 a = (M_2 + mu L_2)^{-1} M_2 F`, with
   `mu = SMOOTHING_C h_r^2` (`h_r^2` = `radial_cell_sq(seq)`, the squared
   physical radial cell). The smoothing damps the radial two-cell mode on
   any mesh and commutes with the divergence.
2. **Electric field** `E = M_1^{-1} load(u x B)`, one k = 1 mass solve.
3. **Increment** `dB = G_1 E`, the topological curl: `div B` is conserved
   exactly and the helicity to the solves.
4. **Step size**. `dt_star = <F, u>_M / ||dB||^2_M` minimises the energy
   along the increment, and `dt = min(dt_star, CFL / cfl_max)`, with `cfl_max`
   the largest logical CFL number of `u`, and `dt <= 1` (the Newton length)
   with Newton.
5. **Resistive step**, with `resistivity > 0`: `resistive_step` below,
   towards `resistive_current`, or towards the enclosed current of `current_profile`.

The energy change of every step is recorded exactly (`dE`) next to the line
search's prediction (`dE_ls`). For a divergence-free `u` they agree to
round-off. The force residual is not monotone.

### Newton

Along the flow of a divergence-free `u` the energy expands to second order
with the gradient `-load(J x B)` and the symmetric Hessian

```
(u, H v) = (Q_u, Q_v)_M + [(B, curl(u x Q_v))_M + (B, curl(v x Q_u))_M] / 2,    Q_u = curl(u x B),
```

at an equilibrium minus the ideal-MHD force operator at `p = 0`
(`mrx.relaxation.newton.second_variation`). `newton_direction` solves
`curl^T H curl a = curl^T load(J x B)` for `u = curl a`, divergence-free by
construction. The right-hand side needs no projection, because `curl^T`
annihilates the gradient and the harmonic part of the force exactly
(`G_2 G_1 = 0`). It is solved by MINRES preconditioned by the harmonic atom (the Laplacian
atom scaled by the lumped parallel derivative of `B`), warm-started from
the previous potential, until the residual falls below `newton_tol` of the
right-hand side or after `newton_maxiter` iterations, with an exit on
nonpositive curvature. `H` vanishes on field-aligned flows `u = f B`, and a
penalty of `newton_penalty` times the strain along the field lifts that
null space.

### Resistive step and drive

`resistive_step(B, seq, eps, J_ref)` is one backward-Euler step of
`dB/dt = -eta curl(curl B - J_ref)` over `eps = eta dt`, `J_ref` a 1-form,
solved for the increment,
`(M_2 + eps L_2) delta = -eps (L_2 B - D_1 J_ref)`
(`seq.shifted(2, eps).solve`, two SPD solves). It is
unconditionally stable and keeps `div B` at the solver tolerance. The drive
of `scripts/relax.py --drive.resistivity C` applies it after every ideal
step with `eps = C h_r^2`. Two targets:

- `--drive.reference`: `J_ref` is the current `M_1^{-1} D_1^T B*` of a reference field `B*`, fixed.
  The field goes to the resistive steady state of that current.
- `--drive.ac`, `--drive.pcurr-type`, `--drive.curtor`: a current profile set as in
  VMEC (`mrx.relaxation.current_profile`), with the net toroidal current `I(s)`
  inside the flux surface `s`. `--drive.current-from-file` takes `I(s)` from the
  geometry file instead (a VMEC wout's `buco`, a current-constrained DESC file's
  `current`). The profile fixes one number per surface, so the
  drive is a loop voltage `E = eta (nu(s) - mu(s)) <B_zeta>(s) grad zeta`, with
  `nu` the field's `mu_0 dI/dPhi` between neighbouring surfaces, `mu` the
  profile's and `<B_zeta>` the surface average of the covariant toroidal field
  (`J_ref = J - E / eta`). Its curl is tangent to the surfaces and it has no
  circulation around poloidal loops, so it keeps the surfaces and the toroidal
  flux inside each, and changes only the poloidal flux. The pressure, which an
  incompressible relaxation holds only through the surfaces, stays. The surfaces are the level sets of the
  temperature `T` of the anisotropic diffusion
  `-div((b b^T + kperp Id) grad T) = 1`, `b = B / |B|`, `kperp = 1e-5`, `T = 0`
  on the wall (`mrx.flux_label`), labelled by the toroidal flux they enclose.
  They are recomputed from the field after the ideal part of every step, by
  conjugate gradients preconditioned by the k = 0 Laplacian atom rescaled
  per Fourier mode by the symbol of the anisotropy, warm-started from the
  last step's `T`. Across islands and chaotic regions `T`, and so `nu` and
  `mu`, is flat.

## 3. Diagnostics

- `compute_helicity(B, seq, A_guess)`: `A` from one k = 1 Hodge solve of
  `L_1 A = D_1^T B`, then `H = <A, P_{21}(B + B_harm)>` with
  `B_harm = B - curl A`.
- `compute_divergence_norm(B, seq)`: `||G_2 B||`, no solve.
- `force_scale(seq, B) = ||grad(|B|^2/2)||`: the scale of the force residual
  `resid = ||F||^2_M / ||grad(|B|^2/2)||^2`, O(1) at any beta.
- `weak_pressure(J, B, seq)` and `beta_vol(B, p_w, seq)`: below.

### Two pressures

**Strong** `p` (from `compute_force`, a 3-form, computed by the sampler once
per chunk): the multiplier of the constrained principle. The force is projected onto the Dirichlet 2-forms
first, which discards its normal component, so `dp/dn = 0` on the wall and
`p` is defined up to a constant. It is the right multiplier for the
descent and blind to the wall force. It is part of the state.

**Weak** `p_w` (from `weak_pressure`, a Dirichlet 0-form): `J x B` is
projected onto the natural 1-forms, which keep its normal component, and
split as `v = F_w + grad p_w` with `p_w = 0` on the wall (one k = 0 Dirichlet
solve). At a fixed point `F_w` vanishes and `dp_w/dn` is the wall force.
Read `p_w` for the pressure profile and beta:
`beta_vol = int p_w dV / int |B|^2/2 dV` in code units. It is computed by the
sampler at every chunk and by `scripts/poincare_trace.py` at the crossings.

## 4. The loop

`State` holds `B_n`, `B_nplus1`, `dt`, `dt_star`, `cfl_max` and three
subtrees: `warm` (the warm starts), `last` (the last step's force,
velocity and iteration counts) and `best` (the field of lowest residual,
its residual and step). `initial_state(B, ts)` evaluates the force once, so
the first step's solves start warm.

`relax(state, ts, steps, chunk, it0, floor_tol, on_chunk)` runs the steps
in compiled chunks (`chunk_runner`: one `lax.scan` of `chunk` steps,
returning the per-step trace), samples the diagnostics once per chunk
(`make_sampler`: energy in the residual precision, helicity, `||J||/||B||`,
`int J . B`, `beta_vol`), calls `on_chunk`, and stops when the chunk mean of
`resid` falls below `floor_tol` or after `steps`. It returns a
`RelaxResult` (the state, the trace, the samples, the stopping reason).
`write_checkpoint` / `read_checkpoint` store and restore a state as one
HDF5 file with the discretisation as attributes (`checkpoint_attrs`).

## 5. Initial conditions

`mrx/relaxation/initial_conditions.py` builds the field in the reference 2-form frame
(`det DPhi B^i`):

```
B_ref = Psi'(r) (0, iota(r) - d lambda / d zeta, 1 + d lambda / d theta)
```

with `Psi` the toroidal flux and `lambda` the angle shift to straight field
lines. This field is divergence-free and tangent to the wall for any
`lambda` and any geometry. `initial_field(seq)` builds it from the
equilibrium file with `potential_two_form(seq)`: the Clebsch potential
`A' = (-lambda Psi', 2 pi Psi, -(2 pi/nfp) chi)`, with `chi` the poloidal
flux, is histopolated on the free 1-forms (its wall trace carries the
toroidal flux), and `B = dA'` is taken by the incidence curl into the
Dirichlet 2-forms. So `div B = 0` to round-off, and no derivative of
`lambda` is ever sampled. It also returns the wall-normal part the
Dirichlet restriction discards, a check of the file.

The field keeps the file's units (tesla and metres for a VMEC wout), so its
current `curl B` is `mu_0` times the file's current.
