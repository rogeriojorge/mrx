"""The settings of a relaxation run, used by ``scripts/relax.py`` and the tutorials.

:class:`RelaxConfig` holds every setting of a run, grouped into small frozen dataclasses (geometry, seeding,
descent method, Newton solve, step budget, resistive drive, output). The defaults on the classes are the
production values, and invalid combinations raise a ``ValueError`` when the config is created. ``relax.py`` turns
the same classes into its command line with ``tyro.cli``. The docstring under each field is its help text, and a
field ``x`` of the group ``g`` is the option ``--g.x`` (underscores written as hyphens). :attr:`RelaxConfig.params`
is the flat record stored as ``params`` in ``relax.json``, and :meth:`RelaxConfig.from_params` rebuilds the config
from it. :meth:`RelaxConfig.stepper` and :meth:`RelaxConfig.relax_kwargs` give what
:func:`~mrx.relaxation.loop.relax` needs.
