"""The initial magnetic field of a relaxation run.

:func:`initial_field` is the entry point. It returns the DoFs of a 2-form ``B`` with zero normal component on
the wall, in the file's units (tesla, metres for a VMEC wout), built from the equilibrium file the sequence was read from
(``seq.equilibrium``, see :mod:`mrx.equilibria`). In logical coordinates it is a field with nested flux surfaces,

    det(DPhi) (B^r, B^theta, B^zeta) = Psi'(r) (0, iota(r) - d lambda / d zeta, 1 + d lambda / d theta),

where ``Psi`` is the toroidal flux and ``lambda`` the angle shift to straight field lines. Such a field has
``B^r = 0``, ``div B = 0`` and ``B . n = 0`` for any ``lambda`` and any geometry.

The discrete field is the discrete curl of a vector potential, so ``div B = 0`` holds exactly
(:func:`potential_two_form`).
