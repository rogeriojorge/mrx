"""Physical quantities of a magnetic field ``B``, given as the coefficients of a 2-form on a
:class:`~mrx.derham_sequence.DeRhamSequence`.

- :func:`compute_force` returns the Lorentz force ``J x B`` with its pressure-gradient part removed, together
  with the pressure and the current. This is the force the relaxation drives to zero.
- :func:`weak_pressure` and :func:`beta_vol` give a pressure that vanishes on the wall and the volume-averaged beta.
- :func:`compute_helicity` and :func:`compute_divergence_norm` monitor the two quantities an ideal relaxation
  should conserve.
- :func:`resistive_step` takes one implicit step of resistive diffusion towards a prescribed current.

All functions are jit-compiled with the sequence as an argument. The first call on a sequence compiles, later
calls on the same sequence (also with a new geometry) reuse the compiled code.
